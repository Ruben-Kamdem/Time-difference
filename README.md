# Time-difference
Algorithm to calculate time difference.
In this algorithm, first the user enter enters the time at two different locations.
Next the time difference between those two places is calculated.
Lastly, the relative time-positions of the two places is announced by the program. 
The innovation here lies in the use classes, function overloading, managing private and public variables as well as conditionals.
